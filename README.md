  - [First Automation MVP](https://github.com/robertobonefont/goldenbot-case-study)  
    Automates lead follow-up, calendar blocking, and invoice creation for solo chefs. Built with GPT-4, Gmail API, and low-code tools. Purpose built for Solo-preneur chefs that need help managing the back-end and the back of the house. 
    <i>“I can cook for 40 people, but I can’t chase 20 leads…”</i>

- <b>Catering Copilot – AI Assistant for Solo Chefs</b>  
  - [Catering Sector Automation](https://github.com/robertobonefont/goldenbot-case-study)  
    Automates lead response, invoice generation, and calendar blocking using GPT-4, Google suite API, and no-code tools, and a light notion powered data-base. Designed for catering managers that are juggling events and inbox chaos.  
    <i>“How do i run a catering operation and the lead generation and follow up while I'm also executing the events?”</i>

- <b>PM Wizard – Strategic Copilot for Product Leaders</b>  
  - [Product Strategy PRD](https://github.com/robertobonefont/quietstak-case-study/blob/main/🧭%20PM%20Wizard%20PRD%20v1.docx)  
    A personalized GPT assistant for PMs to write better PRDs, test hypotheses faster, Generate realistic personas, and align cross-functional teams using HDD and JTBD frameworks. Integrated with Zapier, Notion, and Slack for async flow.

### 📘 Product Strategy & UX Fluency

I specialize in bringing AI-native products to life through a structured, hypothesis-driven approach. My work blends product intuition with evidence-based iteration — grounded in frameworks like Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) and Hypothesis-Driven Development (HDD).

#### 🔁 Discovery & Strategy
- Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) interviews & framing
- Opportunity Trees & roadmap alignment (à la Teresa Torres)
- Hypothesis-Driven Development (HDD) for lean validation
- Strategic experimentation (smoke tests, fake doors, pilot cohorts)

#### 🎯 UX Research & Design
- Conducting moderated and unmoderated user interviews
- Journey mapping, friction identification, and prototype testing
- UX design in Figma (wireframes to high fidelity)
- Accessibility-first and mobile-first design fluency

#### 🛠️ Tools & Tech Fluency
- **AI/LLM**: GPT-4, RAG, embeddings, Copilot integration
- **Design**: Figma, FigJam, Miro
- **Workflows**: Notion, Zapier, Google Workspace APIs
- **Low-Code**: Airtable, Make (Integromat), Replit, Super.so
- **Research**: Dovetail, Maze, Useberry (light), Otter.ai

#### 🧠 PM Practice
- Product requirement documentation in Notion & GitHub
- Signal-driven iteration (email digests, emoji feedback loops, GPT prompt logging)
- Stakeholder alignment through behavioral personas & success metrics
- Discovery tracking with RICE/ICE/Confidence ratings
