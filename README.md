### 📘 Product Strategy & UX Fluency

I specialize in bringing AI-native products to life through a structured, hypothesis-driven approach. My work blends product intuition with evidence-based iteration — grounded in frameworks like Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) and Hypothesis-Driven Development (HDD).

#### 🔁 Discovery & Strategy
- Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) interviews & framing
- Opportunity Trees & roadmap alignment (à la Teresa Torres)
- Hypothesis-Driven Development (HDD) for lean validation
- Strategic experimentation (smoke tests, fake doors, pilot cohorts)

#### 🎯 UX Research & Design
- Conducting moderated and unmoderated user interviews
- Journey mapping, friction identification, and prototype testing
- UX design in Figma (wireframes to high fidelity)
- Accessibility-first and mobile-first design fluency

#### 🛠️ Tools & Tech Fluency
- **AI/LLM**: GPT-4, RAG, embeddings, Copilot integration
- **Design**: Figma, FigJam, Miro
- **Workflows**: Notion, Zapier, Google Workspace APIs
- **Low-Code**: Airtable, Make (Integromat), Replit, Super.so
- **Research**: Dovetail, Maze, Useberry (light), Otter.ai

#### 🧠 PM Practice
- Product requirement documentation in Notion & GitHub
- Signal-driven iteration (email digests, emoji feedback loops, GPT prompt logging)
- Stakeholder alignment through behavioral personas & success metrics
- Discovery tracking with RICE/ICE/Confidence ratings
